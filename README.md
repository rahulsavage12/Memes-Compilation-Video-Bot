## Steps to Follow

* Run the scraper.py python file after you clone the source code to start selenium scraping popular meme subreddits on Reddit.
* After that, a db.json file is used to store all of the links forÂ posts. We may download the posts locally by using the RedDownloader library.
* The downloadedVideos directory is where the downloaded files are kept. Then, using MoviePy, photos are turned into 3-second videos that are combined with video memes and saved as final.mp4.
